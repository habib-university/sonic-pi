## Sequential Execution
- notes play simultaenously
- put `sleep` in between for sequence

## Functions
- in-built functions
- varying numner of parameters for functions
- making own functions
- e.g. `play note`, `release` `decay`, `sustain`, `attack`
- function argument: different `synth`

## Scopes
- e.g. different synths in different scopes
- scopes within a function

## Iteration
